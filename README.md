# [Data Structures & Algorithms](#)

<br />

Implementations of algorithms for coding interview questions, leveraging some data structures and programming languages.

<br />

This side-project showcases my proficiency in handling algorithmic challenges across multiple technology stacks.

<br />

One of my side-projects I work on, to keep my language skills from atrophying.

<br />

Hereâ€™s a sample [Big O Problem-Solution Explanation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KWwbliK1PYVXpt_njYhlCq8t373SC78eb_XJdECacTQ/edit?usp=sharing)
